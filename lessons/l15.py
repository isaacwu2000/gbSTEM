"""Mini Project: Trivia Game (remainder of class) 
    1.  Create at least 3 trivia questions, and prompt the user. 
    2.  Count how many the user gets right, and if they get a score above 70%, they win! 
    3.  If the user fails, they have to redo the trivia quiz until they win. 
    4.  Make sure to randomize the order the questions go in."""
